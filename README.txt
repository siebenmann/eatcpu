Eatcpu is a little program that uses up CPU time, driving up the load
average and consuming user CPU %. It doesn't guarantee that it does this
in any particular way, so it is not a CPU tester; it is simply a way to
use X CPUs for testing how various things respond when the load average
and CPU user% usage rises.
